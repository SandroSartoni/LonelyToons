# Final Presentation
Hi everyone, I'm ... of the group !Lonely Toons and the challenge we've chosen is "Make Sense out of Mars", that is to develop or reuse for
an innovative purpose a set of sensors to be used in human Mars Exploration.  
One aspect that we were struck by was the psychological tone of the crew along the whole mission. Even though NASA astronauts are thoroughly
trained in each and every aspect, psycho-attitudinal one included, we're still humans and fear, depression or loneliness could occur even
in most expert people, especially in innovative missions, pretty much far from Earth, about which few is known.  
This aspect is not new to NASA, infact in a [research](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/991.html)
published on the 23rd of August 2018, the **Third Quarter Phenomenon** is described, according to which in the last quarter of the mission
the crew can experience negative emotions that could possibly lead to problems in the mission itself.  
Starting from this premise, we decided to design a system that is capable of detecting human emotions and to take an appropriate response
according to what is perceived. In order to do this, we thought of three possible solutions that can be integrated together in order to
have a more accurate prediction:
- Face Recognition: 
- Voice Recognition: 
- Wearable sensors: by using a [Biometric Smartshirt and a Biometric Patch](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/2308.html)
  developed by NASA, it's possible to measure biomedic parameters like ECG data, body temperature and levels of physical activity
