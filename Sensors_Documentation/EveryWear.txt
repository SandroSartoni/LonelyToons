# General Description
#####################
EveryWear is an ambulatory system capable of collecting biometric data and statistics of the main vital parameters of the human body.
This system is comprised of three modules: a Biometric Smartshirt, a Biometric Patch and a Space Station iPad, which is provided by Nasa.
The Biometric Smartshirt is an intelligent t-shirt that can collect ECG data, it comprises sensors embedded in the garment fibers of the
shirt and a Bluetooth antenna used to send real time data to the iPad together with a Lithium-Ion battery.
Similarly, the Biometric Patch measures the body temperature and levels of physical activity. The sensor is applied on the subject chest
or forearm using Medical Tape. The patch contains a Bluetooth antenna to communicate real time data to the iPad application and a soldered
rechargeable lithium-ion battery.

# How could we use it
#####################
Since these two wearable devices with embedded sensors already come with a battery and a Bluetooth antenna, we could simply redirect their
data to the processing unit in charge of elaborating all the signals or we could implement a rather simple system that has a Bluetooth
transceiver (or receiver?) that receives data, elaborates it and sends it to the main Processing Unit
